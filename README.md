NASA Space Apps Challenge 2015
--------------------------------
In this we have developed an Android Application in which the "Astronauts" can take pictures and store them in there account.
First when they launch the Application they have to register and then upload can take pictures and 
upload them to their accounts in the Application.
And also can make them as "Post Cards", and share the link with there friends and family members.
Even we are planning to introduce a customized Background where they can choose any background 
for the Picture from the available Backgrounds and their "Custom Background".
We will be also be developing this application for Windows and Apple Platforms.
